    <p class="para"> My favorite hobby is dancing. I love to dance all types of dances like bharatanatyam, bollywood etc. 
      Dancing just gives me joy and happiness. Dancing holds a special place in my life since I was a little girl, I have always loved dancing because it fills my heart with joy. Dancing is an unique art that only requires passion. Dancing is my life and has changed it in numerous ways. For me its the most amazing ways to exercising. One of the most obvious reasons why I dance is that it keeps me fit. Dancing is not just doing any movement you want; it's harder than many people think. It leaves you sweating, but in the end, you feel great and refreshed. Dancing is the best stress releiver, if I feel upset and angry I dance away the pain to make me feel better. Anger makes me dance better. When I dance I feel free and happy again, especially after having a bad day. It's a good way to forget about your stressors, all you need to do is turn on the music and dance your heart out. Dancing is the best medium which people show the world their true colors, showing who they can be. </p>
